I had decided to get my email reminders using any celebrity's voice in my previous post [Alexa AI for reminding important emails and reminders](https://rushichaudhari.github.io/posts/2021-12-19-alexa-remind-emails/). Here is a small step towards it :D 

## If you don't know how Priyanka Chopra sounds like, here is a real sample

## Sample synthesized voice 1

<p>
    <audio class="player" controls preload="none">
        <source src="/img/2022-01-12-Lets-clone-the-voice-of-Priyanka-Chopra-Jonas/slept.wav" type="audio/mp3">
    </audio>
</p>

## Sample synthesized voice 2

<p>
    <audio class="player" controls preload="none">
        <source src="/img/2022-01-12-Lets-clone-the-voice-of-Priyanka-Chopra-Jonas/cycling.wav" type="audio/mp3">
    </audio>
</p>

## Sample synthesized voice 3

<p>
    <audio class="player" controls preload="none">
        <source src="/img/2022-01-12-Lets-clone-the-voice-of-Priyanka-Chopra-Jonas/hopeexp.wav" type="audio/mp3">
    </audio>
</p>

## Real voice of Amitabh Bachchan

## Sample synthesized voice for Amitabh Bachchan

This one is more robotic. I'm still searching for more dataset for this, and once I have that I'd also need to finetune the hifigan

<p>
    <audio class="player" controls preload="none">
        <source src="/img/2022-01-12-Lets-clone-the-voice-of-Priyanka-Chopra-Jonas/amitabh_bachchan_love_the_game.wav" type="audio/mp3">
    </audio>
</p>

## High level overview of how to build the dataset
- Collect videos + their english transcripts
- Some videos on youtube have clean transcripts, some are autogenerated which have many errors
- Make all transcripts lowercase, if the transcripts have errors, fix them manually
- I used [youtube transcript downloader firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-transcript-downloader/) to collect those
- If there are multiple speakers, remove the content from other speaker
- Use Audacity to remove noise and other disturbances :-)

- This work is trained on a reworked version of Tacotron2 model here https://github.com/BenAAndrew/Voice-Cloning-App
- You might also need to finetune the hifigan using [this notebook](/img/2022-01-12-Lets-clone-the-voice-of-Priyanka-Chopra-Jonas/HiFi_GAN_Fine_Tuning.ipynb) or [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ume3953K2K-EdNL90vNqPNSWM1KRuwqp) to remove the robotic voice 


**Note: This codebase is a rabbit hole, and It's too difficult for me to write everything to get started with this, please go through the docs and github issues if you face any difficulties**
