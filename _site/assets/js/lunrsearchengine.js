    "body": "2020/08/19 - ## Another day, again my anaconda crashed for no reason. I decided to never use python on windows without linux vm/ docker. I already had my own docker image created here https://hub. docker. com/repository/docker/rushichaudhari/zipline1. 3. 0/ but I wondered If I could use GUI in it, luckily I managed to do so. So here are the steps :- Pre-requirements:  Windows 10 WSLFor now, it is necessary to install a third-party App to run the GUI Apps, but Microsoft announced on //build 2020 that they will release soon an improvement that will not require any third-party component to run Linux GUI Apps on Windows Desktop. Installing the X Server: The X server is a provider of graphics resources and keyboard/mouse events. I am using the VcXsrv Windows X Server that is open-source and is frequently update. The first step is to install the third-part display manager called VcXsrv Windows X Server available at: https://sourceforge. net/projects/vcxsrv/ After installing launch the xlaunch. exe, make sure disable access control is clicked to avoid permission error Also allow VcxSrv in the firewall Select multiple windows under display settings popup And start with no client. Installing Archlinux on WSL: I’ve used https://github. com/yuk7/ArchWSL/ for linux on WSL because arch is completely bloat free so I could install only what I need and save my space. Its installation is easy, just double-click the Arch. exe and it will be set up. For more details refer here https://github. com/yuk7/ArchWSL/wiki/How-to-Setup After getting Arch shell, Install docker sudo pacman -Syu docker start docker daemon sudo dockerd &amp; The docker image I used was https://hub. docker. com/repository/docker/rushichaudhari/zipline1. 3. 0 which I had built to run zipline without much hassle. I will be pulling the same here. It is pretty heavy 3-4GB, you can use any light image for base os to pull from hub. docker. com. docker pull rushichaudhari/zipline1. 3. 0:firstpush The next step is to set the DISPLAY environment variable on Linux to use the Windows host’s IP address as WSL2 and the Windows host are not in the same network device. It is necessary to run the following bash command to load the correct IP address on launch: Inside WSL linux shell export DISPLAY= `grep nameserver /etc/resolv. conf | sed 's/nameserver //'`:0  Running the following command, it is possible to see that the $DISPLAY environment variable now has the Windows Host’s IP set: echo $DISPLAY Starting the docker: Get the docker Image Id ```sudo docker images`` ​      Run a new docker container using sudo docker run -it 86086b792ad1 /bin/bash Now the current shell would be a archlinux shell which is inside a docker which is inside an archlinux wsl. Map the DISPLAY again like we did before so docker would point to WSL2’s ip address which in turn points to Windows hosts ip address. Inside docker linux shell export DISPLAY= `grep nameserver /etc/resolv. conf | sed 's/nameserver //'`:0  echo $DISPLAY Installing some test applications: 123pacman -S chromium gedit python python3-pip neofetchpacman -S qt5-base libxcb #libraries needed for spyderpip3 install spyderSome applications like chromium doesn’t work on root user create a temp user if needed, switch to this user before running that application. 12useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash testuserpasswd testuserMake sure that XLaunch is running on windows host before starting any app. Lets start gedit 1gedit 1chromium --no-sandbox spyder3 These all apps are not inside host windows neither inside WSL!!: Enjoy :) "

    "body": "2020/07/03 - LSTMS for stock price predictions, worth it ?The internet is now flooded with “predicting stock market prices using LSTM”. I went through 9 articles which I found on websites like medium, KDnuggets, etc. And I realized almost 6-7 out of them showed good results. But none of them showed their real-life use-case, The question is really helpful? LSTMS predict T+1th term by previous k terms of time-series say k=2So we need to have T and T-1 to predict T+2 so suppose my X for input is Open, High, Low, Close, Volumeand Y would be next day’s Close I need to have OHLCV values of the previous 2 days to predict the next day’s Close. This means If I need to know tomorrow’s close, I need to wait till the current day ends to get its OHLCV values i. e. it predicts only 1 candlestick in the future. One article was like using previous k days Close to predict next days Close. so for T+1, I would give it T’s and (T-1)’s Close as inputs and for T+2; T’s, and (predicted_T+1)’s close as input. This is again not useful because if there is an error in T+1; it gets propagated in the next sequence, and also logically we cannot predict movements based on only closing prices. OHLCV may work because it might detect few candlestick patterns like Doji, Harami, etc, and also consider volume. LSTM’s in those articles showed good predictions, because they predict only single value instead of a range of values. So are they worth for a single candlestick? Because even indicators like moving averages give a proper estimate for single candlestick. I think there should be a different approach to use LSTMS, for which unfortunately I didn’t find any article. Please comment down below if you find something. I am not an expert in these fields — I am just putting forward the conclusions I got to after my explorations with this topic, so feel free to point out anything I missed. Thank you for your time. "

If you manage to do this using selenium please comment below. Probably the data is being loaded up as SVG which is why it isn’t being seen in html inspect element.  But… After a look into Network section I found something interesting.  websockets !!! After observing the Headers And Messages I tried to send the same messages using websockets in python and it worked :) . Code at https://github. com/rushic24/tradingview-scraper.

So few frequencies may not be where you expect them to be. To calibrate it we can tune it to a known frequency and adjust the PPM Offset until signal is centered after dongle is running for a while. Kalibrate https://github. com/steve-m/kalibrate-rtlhttps://github. com/steve-m/kalibrate-rtl/wiki/How-to-installkalibrate is a linux tool to auto calibrate. It requires that there are local GSM Signals receivable by the antenna to do the calibration. GSM signals are used because they transmit frequency correction data which calibrate can use to determine the clock offset.
