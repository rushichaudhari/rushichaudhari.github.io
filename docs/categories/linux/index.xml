      <description>I love Thinkpads. They are robust and durable. And no need to mention about their world class keyboards!
It works like a charm, but we need to configure it a bit for silence. Let&amp;rsquo;s start!
1. Install the necessary package sudo apt install thinkfan 2. Create the configuration file After installing the package we need to create a config file in the following directory: /etc/thinkfan.conf
This file requires three main items:</description>

      <description>Traditionally we have been using Xorg or X11 as the display server on linux. Wayland is a similar display server which aims to be a modern and more optimized. I&amp;rsquo;m not much used to wayland and this is a guide for using wayvnc, a vnc server for wayland. Any vnc client like tigervnc/ realvncviewer can be used.
# Install wayvnc sudo pacman -S wayvnc Create a config with the authentication info and load it using the &amp;ndash;config command line option or place it at the default location $HOME/.</description>

      <description>The Pinephone[1] is my first Linux smartphone. I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for this since 2018. I feel the more android is advancing the more it is getting IOS&amp;rsquo;ish. Android was not meant to be this way. The reason it became popular early was it being opensource, and developer friendly. That era allowed bootloader unlocking, developing custom and newer kernels, tweaking the UI. Newer android has become too much bloatish and restrictive. For instance if we see miracast, android dropped miracast support for non samsung devices after android 8.</description>

      <description>Watch Netflix from restricted regions Use: Some Netflix shows are only available in India, Let us proxy through some Indian server to watch Netflix
# In terminal 1 # 9050 is default port for proxychains socksproxy # something@someIP should be some Indian server ssh something@someIP -D 9050 # In terminal 2 proxychains firefox # Check the IP using https://www.whatismyipaddress.com It should show the ip of the ssh server(India), Now you can watch Indian Netflix :D VNC over SSH tunnel Best alternative if Anydesk/ Teamviewer fails on linux</description>

      <description>Motivation :- It was the third time I missed reading my email and picking up shifts for my oncampus job. I did try creating labels and filtering them but that didn&amp;rsquo;t show any progress in improvement. It&amp;rsquo;s really stressful when I get the notification that something needs a response from me right away. I had to make sure that I was not missing this next time. It is then when I decided I need to build a system to process and remind me this.</description>

      <description>I have two efi partitions, p1 for windows and p4 for Arch
sudo fdisk -l
Add the efi entry in /etc/fstab
get the UUID from sudo blkid
Mount the /efi
sudo mount /efi &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ls /efi
The structure would look something like
Install ucode for my amd machine it is
sudo pacman -S amd-ucode
Reinstall linux kernel
sudo pacman -S linux linux-headers
mkinitcpio -P
Add the following in
sudo nano /efi/loader/entries/arch.</description>

      <description>I had recently moved to awesomewm from i3wm, some default keybindings were different and It had a really cool command to access cheatsheet which looked like below
Then I got a linux phone where swaywm was highly popular in development, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything good enough to create that cheatsheet like the one found in awesomewm. This script allows me to parse the swaywm config, and create a cheatsheet. It can later be made more pretty through https://carbon.</description>

      <description>You can easily change the Docker default storage location by creating the daemon.json file and pointing to another location in that file.
It happened to me several times that I didnâ€™t have enough space in my root partition to store Docker containers and I had to move the Docker default storage location to another partition. In this post, I wrote down how to do that for my readership and future myself :)</description>

      <description>This guide assumes you already know what is docker and docker, vncviewer installed on your system The docker image given at https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&amp;amp;type=image is a blank kali image with 0 tools.
Let us create a light-weight custom image with the tools needed. The following are the tools which I think are commonly used in kali you can add/remove a few from that list.

      <description>I came across this wonderful video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44. It took me into searching for its code to implement that. And here are a few.
https://github.com/Mario-brows/Brows-Super-Mario https://github.com/lopatin96/Lua-SNES-GenNeurNetwork The main problem in them is they use BizHawk Emulator, which I was not successful in compiling for my debian OS, Its stable only for windows machines. Then I found its alternative fceux Which can handle lua scripts too!.
The following steps are what I used to compile it successfully.</description>
