      <description>You can easily change the Docker default storage location by creating the daemon.json file and pointing to another location in that file.
It happened to me several times that I didnâ€™t have enough space in my root partition to store Docker containers and I had to move the Docker default storage location to another partition. In this post, I wrote down how to do that for my readership and future myself :)</description>

      <description>This guide assumes you already know what is docker and docker, vncviewer installed on your system The docker image given at https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&amp;amp;type=image is a blank kali image with 0 tools.
Let us create a light-weight custom image with the tools needed. The following are the tools which I think are commonly used in kali you can add/remove a few from that list.
