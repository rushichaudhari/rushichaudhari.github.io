      <description>I came across this awesome project called Real Time Voice Cloning by Corentin Jemine and I wanted to give it a shot. Iâ€™m currently working on a Arch linux machine with GPU, that could easily run the toolbox, but I wanted an easy way to get everything setup. Docker would do the trick as far as getting it setup, and then through forwarding the X Window System via SSH, I could view and control the program locally as it ran remotely.</description>
