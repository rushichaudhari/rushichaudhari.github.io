      <description>Creating an GitHub OAuth App First, go to GitHub Dev Settings and click New OAuth App. Or just click here: https://github.com/settings/developers
Enter whatever you like for Application name and Homepage URL.
In Authorization callback URL, enter: https://api.netlify.com/auth/done.
Once finished, leave the page in the background. You will need the Client ID and Client Secret on this page later.
Creating a Netlify Site … Relax! We’re just creating one, without actually using it.</description>

      <description>This guide assumes you already know what is docker and docker, vncviewer installed on your system The docker image given at https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&amp;amp;type=image is a blank kali image with 0 tools.
Let us create a light-weight custom image with the tools needed. The following are the tools which I think are commonly used in kali you can add/remove a few from that list.

      <description>In the previous year, I had posted a script to fill google forms using selenium, and containerizing it with docker to run it parallelly. This is an alternative way to do the same using post requests.
I had created a google form using the default template shown below.
Which had fields like To get started we need to capture the request. I&amp;rsquo;ve used burp suite tool to capture, there are many alternative tools you can google.</description>

      <description>LSTMS for stock price predictions, worth it ? The internet is now flooded with &amp;ldquo;predicting stock market prices using LSTM&amp;rdquo;. I went through 9 articles which I found on websites like medium, KDnuggets, etc. And I realized almost 6-7 out of them showed good results. But none of them showed their real-life use-case, The question is really helpful?
LSTMS predict T+1th term by previous k terms of time-series say k=2 So we need to have T and T-1 to predict T+2</description>

      <description>I came across this wonderful video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44. It took me into searching for its code to implement that. And here are a few.
https://github.com/Mario-brows/Brows-Super-Mario https://github.com/lopatin96/Lua-SNES-GenNeurNetwork The main problem in them is they use BizHawk Emulator, which I was not successful in compiling for my debian OS, Its stable only for windows machines. Then I found its alternative fceux Which can handle lua scripts too!.
The following steps are what I used to compile it successfully.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, when using i3wm I get this error when mounting a partition. But it works for other des like gnome/cinnamon.
Make sure polkit is installed.
Loosen the polkit permissions in your system to allow your normal user to mount devices by creating a file at /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/org.freedesktop.automount.plka (as root!) with the following content:
[Allow Unauthorized mounting/Unmounting] Identity=unix-group:plugdev;cdrom Action=org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-*;org.freedesktop.udisks2.eject* ResultAny=yes ResultInactive=yes ResultActive=yes You can loosen the polkit permissions in your system to allow your normal user to mount devices by creating a file at /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.</description>

      <description>Another day, again my anaconda crashed for no reason. I decided to never use python on windows without linux vm/ docker.
I already had my own docker image created here https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rushichaudhari/zipline1.3.0/
but I wondered If I could use GUI in it, luckily I managed to do so.
So here are the steps :-
Pre-requirements:
 Windows 10 WSL  For now, it is necessary to install a third-party App to run the GUI Apps, but Microsoft announced on //build 2020 that they will release soon an improvement that will not require any third-party component to run Linux GUI Apps on Windows Desktop.</description>

      <description>Installing tigervnc sudo pacman -Ss tigervnc Editing the environment file ~/.vnc/xstartup functions like .xinitrc and it&amp;rsquo;s sourced by vncserver when being started. At a minimum, users should start a DE from this file. As an example, to start lxde, you&amp;rsquo;ll modify the file to:
$nano ~/.vnc/xstartup #!/bin/bash exec lxde &amp;amp;&amp;gt;/dev/null The file should be executable: $ chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup Adding vncserver options $ nano ~/.vnc/config desktop=sandbox geometry=1920x1080 dpi=96 SecurityTypes=none Starting and stopping vncserver via systemd To control vncserver with systemd, first, create systemd unit file for the user</description>

      <description>Unfortunately only 3-4% of citizens in the US are vegetarian. After rambling around nearby streets, I got to know veg stuff was obscured everywhere. Even Subway/McDonald&#39;s were no exception. So here is a dynamic N00Bs guide in becoming a Masterchef with vegetarian things available in Boston. Masala Khichidi with Kadhi Pizza toppings on bread P.S. Pizza base coss around 4$ for 2, bread is 1.6$ for a loaf.

      <description>How I webscraped 1 minute stock data from tradingview After a long die-hard trying I managed to get 1 minute stock data for free. My previous tries were using selenium and beautifulsoup modules in python. But the data is highly obfuscated so I was not able to find the exact HTML element to scrape. If you manage to do this using selenium please comment below.
Probably the data is being loaded up as SVG which is why it isn&amp;rsquo;t being seen in html inspect element.</description>
