      <description>Traditionally we have been using Xorg or X11 as the display server on linux. Wayland is a similar display server which aims to be a modern and more optimized. I&amp;rsquo;m not much used to wayland and this is a guide for using wayvnc, a vnc server for wayland. Any vnc client like tigervnc/ realvncviewer can be used.
# Install wayvnc sudo pacman -S wayvnc Create a config with the authentication info and load it using the &amp;ndash;config command line option or place it at the default location $HOME/.</description>

      <description>A comparison of different Face Detection APIs in the industry Why do we need an opensource face detection APIs ? Consider we have around 80,000 videos which consists of around a total of 72 million frames. Below is an analysis of how different competitor’s face detection APIs would cost for 72 million frames. Some people have a myth that opensource models don’t work that well compared to these premium services. I’ve also shared a few test screenshots on how even premium service give false positives.</description>

      <description>Scraping dynamic content these days is bit difficult as there are wide variety of authentication mechanisms and web server needs correct headers, session, cookies to authenticate the request. If we need to quickly scrape content just for once, implementing authenticationis an overhead. Instead, we can manually login to the website, capture an authenticated request and use it for scraping other pages by changing url/form parameters.

      <description>The Pinephone[1] is my first Linux smartphone. I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for this since 2018. I feel the more android is advancing the more it is getting IOS&amp;rsquo;ish. Android was not meant to be this way. The reason it became popular early was it being opensource, and developer friendly. That era allowed bootloader unlocking, developing custom and newer kernels, tweaking the UI. Newer android has become too much bloatish and restrictive. For instance if we see miracast, android dropped miracast support for non samsung devices after android 8.</description>

      <description>I came across this awesome project called Real Time Voice Cloning by Corentin Jemine and I wanted to give it a shot. I’m currently working on a Arch linux machine with GPU, that could easily run the toolbox, but I wanted an easy way to get everything setup. Docker would do the trick as far as getting it setup, and then through forwarding the X Window System via SSH, I could view and control the program locally as it ran remotely.</description>

      <description>Motivation :- It was the third time I missed reading my email and picking up shifts for my oncampus job. I did try creating labels and filtering them but that didn&amp;rsquo;t show any progress in improvement. It&amp;rsquo;s really stressful when I get the notification that something needs a response from me right away. I had to make sure that I was not missing this next time. It is then when I decided I need to build a system to process and remind me this.</description>

      <description>Are you irritated by google colab automatically disconnecting after every 30mins ? Open your Chrome DevTools and enter the following JavaScript snippet in your console:
function KeepClicking(){ console.log(&amp;quot;Clicking&amp;quot;); document.querySelector(&amp;quot;colab-connect-button&amp;quot;).click() } setInterval(KeepClicking,60000) This clicks the connect button every 60 seconds, there is no need to worry about colab being disconnected!
This is different from the GPU time, colab can still disconnect you for long running background tasks on GPU. </description>

Install Vagrant
sudo pacman -S vagrant vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest vagrant-share Note: There is also vagrant libvirt plugin for qemu
vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt but this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with kubeflow
Install virtualbox
sudo pacman -S virtualbox  for the linux kernel, choose virtualbox-host-modules-arch for any other kernel (including linux-lts), choose virtualbox-host-dkms  Load the vbox drv module
sudo modprobe vboxdrv Make sure to put path for Virtualbox where you have a lot of space (50GB+)</description>

sudo fdisk -l
Add the efi entry in /etc/fstab
get the UUID from sudo blkid
Mount the /efi
sudo mount /efi &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ls /efi
The structure would look something like
Install ucode for my amd machine it is
sudo pacman -S amd-ucode
Reinstall linux kernel
sudo pacman -S linux linux-headers
mkinitcpio -P
Add the following in
sudo nano /efi/loader/entries/arch.</description>

      <description>How I webscraped 1 minute stock data from tradingview After a long die-hard trying I managed to get 1 minute stock data for free. My previous tries were using selenium and beautifulsoup modules in python. But the data is highly obfuscated so I was not able to find the exact HTML element to scrape. If you manage to do this using selenium please comment below.
Probably the data is being loaded up as SVG which is why it isn&amp;rsquo;t being seen in html inspect element.</description>

      <description>You can easily change the Docker default storage location by creating the daemon.json file and pointing to another location in that file.
It happened to me several times that I didn’t have enough space in my root partition to store Docker containers and I had to move the Docker default storage location to another partition. In this post, I wrote down how to do that for my readership and future myself :)</description>

      <description>The internet is now flooded with “predicting stock market prices using LSTM”. I went through 9 articles that I found on websites like medium, KDnuggets, etc. And I realized almost 6-7 out of them showed promising results. But none of them showed their real-life use-case; the question is is it beneficial?
LSTMS predict T+1th term by previous k terms of time-series, say k=2, So we need to have T and T-1 to predict T+2 so suppose my X for input is Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Y would be the next day’s Close</description>

      <description>In the previous year, I had posted a script to fill google forms using selenium, and containerizing it with docker to run it parallelly. This is an alternative way to do the same using post requests.
I had created a google form using the default template shown below.
Which had fields like To get started we need to capture the request. I&amp;rsquo;ve used burp suite tool to capture, there are many alternative tools you can google.</description>

      <description>I came across this wonderful video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44. It took me into searching for its code to implement that. And here are a few.
https://github.com/Mario-brows/Brows-Super-Mario https://github.com/lopatin96/Lua-SNES-GenNeurNetwork The main problem in them is they use BizHawk Emulator, which I was not successful in compiling for my debian OS, Its stable only for windows machines. Then I found its alternative fceux Which can handle lua scripts too!.
The following steps are what I used to compile it successfully.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, when using i3wm I get this error when mounting a partition. But it works for other des like gnome/cinnamon.
Make sure polkit is installed.
Loosen the polkit permissions in your system to allow your normal user to mount devices by creating a file at /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/org.freedesktop.automount.plka (as root!) with the following content:
[Allow Unauthorized mounting/Unmounting] Identity=unix-group:plugdev;cdrom Action=org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-*;org.freedesktop.udisks2.eject* ResultAny=yes ResultInactive=yes ResultActive=yes You can loosen the polkit permissions in your system to allow your normal user to mount devices by creating a file at /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.</description>

      <description>Another day, again my anaconda crashed for no reason. I decided to never use python on windows without linux vm/ docker.
I already had my own docker image created here https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rushichaudhari/zipline1.3.0/
but I wondered If I could use GUI in it, luckily I managed to do so.
So here are the steps :-
Pre-requirements:
 Windows 10 WSL  For now, it is necessary to install a third-party App to run the GUI Apps, but Microsoft announced on //build 2020 that they will release soon an improvement that will not require any third-party component to run Linux GUI Apps on Windows Desktop.</description>
