      <title>Running the Real Time Voice Cloning in Docker on Arch Linux</title>

      <description>I came across this awesome project called Real Time Voice Cloning by Corentin Jemine and I wanted to give it a shot. Iâ€™m currently working on a Arch linux machine with GPU, that could easily run the toolbox, but I wanted an easy way to get everything setup. Docker would do the trick as far as getting it setup, and then through forwarding the X Window System via SSH, I could view and control the program locally as it ran remotely.</description>

      <description>Motivation :- It was the third time I missed reading my email and picking up shifts for my oncampus job. I did try creating labels and filtering them but that didn&amp;rsquo;t show any progress in improvement. It&amp;rsquo;s really stressful when I get the notification that something needs a response from me right away. I had to make sure that I was not missing this next time. It is then when I decided I need to build a system to process and remind me this.</description>
