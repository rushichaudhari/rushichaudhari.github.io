      <description>I had recently moved to awesomewm from i3wm, some default keybindings were different and It had a really cool command to access cheatsheet which looked like below
Then I got a linux phone where swaywm was highly popular in development, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything good enough to create that cheatsheet like the one found in awesomewm. This script allows me to parse the swaywm config, and create a cheatsheet. It can later be made more pretty through https://carbon.</description>
