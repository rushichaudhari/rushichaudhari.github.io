      <description>I love Thinkpads. They are robust and durable. And no need to mention about their world class keyboards!
It works like a charm, but we need to configure it a bit for silence. Let&amp;rsquo;s start!
1. Install the necessary package sudo apt install thinkfan 2. Create the configuration file After installing the package we need to create a config file in the following directory: /etc/thinkfan.conf
This file requires three main items:</description>

      <description>Traditionally we have been using Xorg or X11 as the display server on linux. Wayland is a similar display server which aims to be a modern and more optimized. I&amp;rsquo;m not much used to wayland and this is a guide for using wayvnc, a vnc server for wayland. Any vnc client like tigervnc/ realvncviewer can be used.
# Install wayvncsudo pacman -S wayvnc Create a config with the authentication info and load it using the &amp;ndash;config command line option or place it at the default location $HOME/.</description>

      <description>The Pinephone[1] is my first Linux smartphone. I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for this since 2018. I feel the more android is advancing the more it is getting IOS&amp;rsquo;ish. Android was not meant to be this way. The reason it became popular early was it being opensource, and developer friendly. That era allowed bootloader unlocking, developing custom and newer kernels, tweaking the UI. Newer android has become too much bloatish and restrictive. For instance if we see miracast, android dropped miracast support for non samsung devices after android 8.</description>

      <description>Watch Netflix from restricted regions Use: Some Netflix shows are only available in India, Let us proxy through some Indian server to watch Netflix
# In terminal 1 # 9050 is default port for proxychains socksproxy# something@someIP should be some Indian serverssh something@someIP -D 9050 # In terminal 2proxychains firefox# Check the IP using https://www.whatismyipaddress.com It should show the ip of the ssh server(India), Now you can watch Indian Netflix :D VNC over SSH tunnel Best alternative if Anydesk/ Teamviewer fails on linux</description>

      <description>I had recently moved to awesomewm from i3wm, some default keybindings were different and It had a really cool command to access cheatsheet which looked like below
Then I got a linux phone where swaywm was highly popular in development, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything good enough to create that cheatsheet like the one found in awesomewm. This script allows me to parse the swaywm config, and create a cheatsheet. It can later be made more pretty through https://carbon.</description>
